              Diet is the essential key to all successful healing.
               Without a properly balanced diet,

          "Don't allow a love problem or work problem to become an eating problem. 
          Stop trying to stuff your feelings down with food." – Karen Salmansohn
          "Healthy eating is a way of life, so it's important to 
          establish routines that are simple, realistically, and ultimately livable." – Horace
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          “This is what people don’t understand: obesity is a symptom of poverty. 
          It’s not a lifestyle choice where people are just eating and not exercising. 
          It’s because kids – and this is the problem with the school lunch right now
           – are getting sugar, fat and empty calories – lots of calories –but no nutrition.” – Tom Colicchio
